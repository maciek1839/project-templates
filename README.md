## README

### General

A general-purpose README contains basic information about a medium-sized project. The template can be easily customizable by removing redundant sections. For a big-sized project I recommend to use Confluence where you can put all necessary information and all the teams can update the documentation (make a README file simple keeping some basic information like a technology stack or a project setup including links to Confluence if necessary).
